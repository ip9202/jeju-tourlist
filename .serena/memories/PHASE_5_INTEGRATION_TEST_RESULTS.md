## Verified Integrations

✅ **Frontend-to-Backend API Flow**:

- Like button → POST /api/answers/:id/reaction
- Dislike button → POST /api/answers/:id/reaction
- Adopt button → POST /api/answers/:id/accept
- Unadopt button → DELETE /api/answers/:id/accept

✅ **Data Synchronization**:

- Like/Dislike counts update in real-time
- Adoption status persists in UI and database
- Points increase on adoption
- Badges auto-awarded on criteria met

✅ **Error Handling**:

- Invalid requests handled gracefully
- HTTP status codes returned correctly
- No console errors on failures
- Page remains stable after errors

✅ **Performance**:

- API responses within 4 seconds
- Button interactions responsive (< 600ms)
- Network requests properly formed
- Request body contains required fields

✅ **Accessibility**:

- All buttons maintain aria-labels after API calls
- Semantic HTML structure preserved
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained
